# Create candlestick charts using HTML Canvas

This open source package will seek to solve only one problem - creating static candlestick charts in an app from a source of data that will plot using HTML Canvas and a sprinkle of JavaScript.

At the moment, it will only serve daily candlestick charts for a 100 data points (aka 100 day chart, about 5 months worth of data.) If this project picks up, or if there is enough time available, I'd like to develop additional features.
